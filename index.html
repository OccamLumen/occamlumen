        <br>
        tastes better than you expect
        <br>
        makes you feel connected to the grass that milker ate all day

        if you write a test and know its unreliable, literally stop
        <br>
        just fix the darned thing
        <br>
        you cannot justify just <strong>not</strong> fixing something because you are <em>busy</em>
        <br>
        take ownership of mistakes and broken things
        <br>
        fix the broken windows
        <br>
