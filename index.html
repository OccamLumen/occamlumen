        if you write a test and know its unreliable, literally stop
        <br>
        just fix the darned thing

        you cannot justify just <strong>not</strong> fixing something because you are <em>busy</em>
        <br>
        take ownership of mistakes and broken things

        fix the broken windows

        if you desire a woman, train yourself in the ways of the Lord
        <br>
        pray for your future wife
        <br>
        become one with the woman God gives you
        <br>
        oneness is a process
        <br>
        oneness accomplished is an ethereal and orgasmic state
        <br>
        oneness of three parties: man, wife, and the Godhead (recursively three-in-one)

        1 corinthians 11 puts you as head of your wife
        <br>
        Jesus Christ is head of the husband though
        <br>
        be awefully fearful of your head
        <br>
        the man who listens to the wisdom of a godly wife is more equipped

        please stop thinking you have a vagine

        God will help her yeetus that fetus into reality

        also, dear God, do not make your wife work and let her love babies

        i am deeply troubled

        i am deeply pained

        i am deeply frustrated
        <br>
        i feel utterly ignored
        <br>
        i feel utterly bridled
        <br>
        i feel utterly alone
        <br>
        why you ask?
        <br>
        because some men cannot set aside their ignorance
        <br>
        because some man cannot treat others with respect
        <br>
        because some men cannot value that which another understands greater than he
        <br>
        because some men can do nothing but look at greater things than them,
        <br>
        and scoff at the incomprehensibility
        <br>
        like a man rejecting a God beyond his understanding,
        <br>
        a man who rejects that which he does not know is lost in his own darkness
      <blockquote cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A18-23&version=ESV">
        <p>
          <strong>18</strong> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
          of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.
          <br>
          <strong>19</strong> For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.
          <br>
          <strong>20</strong> For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been
          clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are
          without excuse.
          <br>
          <strong>21</strong> For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they
          became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.
          <br>
          <strong>22</strong> Claiming to be wise, they became fools,
          <br>
          <strong>23</strong> and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and
          animals and creeping things.

        Every single app these days is a worse rendition of that which already was
        <br>
        GitHub is BAD
        <br>
        GitLab is UGLY, but it was significantly better than GitHub for private usage
        <br>
        See, if you were an academic, GitHub private repos could be free but it was SILLY
        <br>
        I preferred to support GitLab
        <br>
        People would CRY and say "But the REAAAAAAAL open source is on GitHub"
